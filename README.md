# EManzano--EdTech-AI
Professional Portfolio

👋 Hi, I'm Esther!
Educator & AI Evaluator in Training
Focus: AI response evaluation, instruction‑following, and educational content quality

🚀 About Me:
I am a professional K–8 educator transitioning into the AI evaluation space. I draw on 30 years of experience in curriculum design, assessment, and rubric‑based grading to judge whether Large Language Models (LLMs) produce accurate, clear, and age‑appropriate outputs.
In 2025, I began contract work as an AI Evaluator, reviewing AI‑generated responses for accuracy, clarity, safety, and guideline compliance. I am currently deepening my skills through a job‑oriented AI/ML/GenAI program, with a focus on becoming a stronger evaluator and eventually taking on more technical tasks.

🔍 Evaluation Strengths:
AI response evaluation: accuracy, clarity, safety, and instruction‑following
Guideline and rubric interpretation
Factuality checking and basic hallucination detection
Clear written explanations and feedback
Strong attention to detail and consistency across large batches of items

🐍 Developing Technical Skills:
Early‑beginner Python: practicing variables, loops, functions, and basic data structures
Learning how Python is used in AI and data workflows through structured coursework
Building comfort with writing clear, readable code and following basic style guidelines
Using notebooks and small exercises to gradually expand technical skills

🛠️ Tools & Platforms:
AI evaluation platforms (e.g., tasking tools and dashboards)
Google Workspace, Microsoft Office, and common LMS/EdTech tools
Time‑tracking and remote work tools (e.g., Hubstaff)
GitHub as a learning and portfolio space

📈 Learning & Portfolio Projects:
AI‑Evaluation Notes: Reflections and examples from my work evaluating AI‑generated responses, focusing on how I apply rubrics, identify common model errors, and document feedback.
Python Practice Labs: Beginner‑level exercises where I practice Python fundamentals and gradually explore simple data tasks.

🎓 Background:
30 years of K–8 teaching experience across private, Christian, and public schools
Master of Science in Curriculum and Instruction (Western Governors University)
Additional graduate‑level work in Educational Administration
Licensed and certified K–8 educator with experience designing and grading assessments
